# automatically use showtext to render text

```


# 2. Data Wrangling
```{r}
# Read in tweets
tweets <- read_csv("../data/uk_tweets_01122019_01052020_VADER_removed_dpl_RT_and_status_id_only.csv")
glimpse(tweets)
```


Formatting dates
```{r}
# split string character date
date_df <- tweets$created_at %>% 
  str_split(" ", simplify = TRUE) %>% 
  as.data.frame()
date_df %>% head(5)

# create date variable
tweets$date <- ymd(date_df$V1)
  
rm(date_df)
```

```{r}
#remove

# country id
tweets$cntry_id <- 1 # uk

```


## Select sample for this analysis
```{r}
tweets <- tweets %>% dplyr::filter(between(
  date, as.Date("2020-01-15"),
  as.Date("2020-02-15")
  )
  )
```

# 3. Sentiment Analysis

## 3.1. Getting the scores
```{r}
vader_sentiment <- vader_df(tweets$VADER_text)
```

Computing summary metrics
```{r}
#join data
df <- cbind(tweets$date, vader_sentiment, tweets$retweet_count, tweets$quoted_tweet, tweets$created_at, tweets$status_id)

df <- df %>% dplyr::rename(date = `tweets$date`,
                retweet_count = `tweets$retweet_count`, 
                quoted_tweet = `tweets$quoted_tweet`,
                over_tweet_sent = compound,
                hour = `tweets$created_at`,
                status_id = `tweets$status_id`)


# day level sentiment score - check
day_sent <- df %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    wave_sent = weighted.mean(over_tweet_sent, retweet_count),
    ave_sent = mean(over_tweet_sent)
    )

# add vars
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(pn_sent = 
           case_when(
           over_tweet_sent == 0 ~ 0,
           over_tweet_sent > 0 ~ 1,
           over_tweet_sent < 0 ~ 2
           ), # id for neutral, positive and negative sentiment
         pn5c_sent =
           case_when(
           over_tweet_sent >= -.05 & over_tweet_sent <= .05 ~ 3,
           over_tweet_sent < -.5 ~ 1,
           over_tweet_sent < -.05 & over_tweet_sent >= -.5 ~ 2,
           over_tweet_sent > .05 & over_tweet_sent <= .5 ~ 4,
           over_tweet_sent > .5 ~ 5,
           )
         )
```

Expanding the dataset 
```{r}
# create function to expand the data
apply_weightings <- function (x) {
  x <- x[rep(row.names(x), x$retweet_count), c('date', 'text','over_tweet_sent','retweet_count','status_id', 'hour')]
}

wdf <- apply_weightings(df)
```


## 3.2 Total number of tweets
```{r}
sum(df$retweet_count)
```

## 3.3 Numbers by day
```{r}
df %>% group_by(date) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(sum = retweet_count) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = date, y = sum)) +
  #geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, size=2, span = 0.15, color="#238A8DFF") +
  theme_tufte()
```


## 3.3. Distribution

Raw SS
```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data=df) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = over_tweet_sent, 
                   weight = retweet_count/sum(retweet_count)), 
                 binwidth = 0.05,
                 fill = "#440154FF",
                 alpha = 1) +
  #facet_grid(. ~ cntry_id) +
  theme_tufte() + 
  theme(text = element_text(family="robotocondensed",
                            size = 20)) +
  labs(x= "Tweet sentiment score",
       y = "Density")
```

Checking weights have been applied correctly
```{r}
ggplot(data=wdf) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = over_tweet_sent), 
                 binwidth = 0.05,
                 fill = "#440154FF",
                 alpha = 1) +
  #facet_grid(. ~ cntry_id) +
  theme_tufte() + 
  theme(text = element_text(family="robotocondensed",
                            size = 20)) +
  labs(x= "Tweet sentiment score",
       y = "Density")
```


```{r}
p2 <- ggplot(wdf, aes(over_tweet_sent)) + 
  stat_ecdf(geom = "step",
            size = 2,
            colour = "#440154FF") +
  theme_tufte() + 
  theme(text = element_text(family="robotocondensed",
                            size = 20)) +
  labs(x= "Tweet sentiment score",
       y = "Cumulative density")
```

```{r}
png("../outputs/oss_dist_uk.png", units="in", width=10, height=7, res=300)
p1 + p2 + plot_layout(widths = c(1, 1))
dev.off()
```


```{r}
ggplot(data=df) +
  geom_density(aes(x = over_tweet_sent), 
               fill = "blue",
               alpha = 0.6) +
  #facet_grid(. ~ cntry_id) +
  theme_tufte()
```


Examining outliers
> Lots of the very high positive SSs involve tweets on having got Brexit done

```{r}
outlier <- df %>% dplyr::filter(over_tweet_sent > .55 | over_tweet_sent < -.55)
outlier %>% dplyr::select(over_tweet_sent, text) %>% head()
```

Examining ~ 0 SSs

Shall small SSs be categorised as 0?
```{r}
near_zero <- df %>% dplyr::filter(over_tweet_sent <= .05 & over_tweet_sent >= -.05)
near_zero %>% dplyr::select(over_tweet_sent, text) %>% head()
```

Raw SS removing neutral SSs (ie 0s)
```{r}
df %>% dplyr::filter(pn_sent | 0) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_density(aes(x = over_tweet_sent,
                   weight = retweet_count/sum(retweet_count)),
               fill = "blue", 
               alpha = 0.6) +
  #facet_grid(. ~ cntry_id) +
  theme_tufte()
```

## 3.4. Frequencies

```{r}

## 3.8 Word Cloud Analysis

Joining data to add lexicon like text
```{r}
tweets2 <- read_csv("../data/uk_tweets_01122019_01052020.csv") %>% 
  dplyr::select(status_id, lexicon_text)

wc_df <- left_join(wdf, tweets2, by = c("status_id" = "status_id"))
```


```{r}
word_count <- function(x) {
  data(stop_words)
  misc_words <- tibble(word = c("it's", "i've", "lot", "set", "he's", "rt", "-"))
  x <- tibble(id = 1:nrow(x), text = x$lexicon_text)
  x$text <- gsub("[0-9]+", "", x$text)
  x <- x %>% unnest_tokens(word, text)
  x <- x %>% anti_join(stop_words)
  x <- x %>% anti_join(misc_words)
  x <- x %>% dplyr::count(word, sort = TRUE)
}

word_cloud <- function(x, y, z) {
  x <- wordcloud(words = x$word, freq = x$n, min.freq = y,
                 scale=c(5,.2),
          max.words = z, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35,
          colors=brewer.pal(8, "RdBu"))
}

filter_date <- function(x,y,z) {
  x <- x %>% dplyr::filter(between(date, as.Date(y), as.Date(z) ) )
}
```

Breakdown word clouds into positive and negative

So the first value y is the minimum number of times a word must occur across all tweets to be considered. The second z is the max number of words to be included in the word cloud

* China poses an “existential threat” to the international human rights system, according to a new report released today by Human Rights Watch (@anonymous after the organization’s executive director was denied entry to Hong Kong at the weekend. http://url_removed
* Priti Patel gets it  "The people expect us to do what we say, from crime to immigration, to leaving the EU. We are ready to listen and do what they want.  It's called democracy.  They are our masters and we are their servants  Our job is to deliver on their priorities." http://url_removed

*	BREAKING   Leave Means Leave have been given approval to hold an event in Parliament Square on 31st January. Great news!  It is a big moment in the history of this nation to celebrate.
* Like me, you may have been wondering about the happy EU millennials in this video who smilingly welcome the @anonymous benign new immigration regime. They really get around these EU nationals. Here they are advertising a bank in Australia: http://url_removed (https://twitter.com/BorderIrish/status/1078352682216235008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1078352682216235008%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Feuropestreet.news%2Fcontroversy-mounts-over-uk-settled-status-residence-scheme-to-open-to-all-eu-nationals-on-january-21%2F)

POSITIVE
* Met #brexit lady again today. She's peed off. Had to apply for residency, register for tax, matriculate cars, join healthcare system, swap driving licence etc, all at a cost. Not what she voted for, she just wanted to stop EU immigration to UK, not stop her living in Portugal.
* I like to think (imagine, hope) that I can comprehend why people take a wide range of political positions, left and right; but I cannot get my head around this. ‘Unaccompanied child refugees being able to join their families ...’ Isn’t that just obvious? Am I missing something? http://url_removed
* After GE2019, Boris Johnson said he wanted to be “friends” with Remainers.  He has now rejected the Erasmus+ and Child Refugee amendments.  Accepting either or both of those would have been such a positive gesture of friendship &amp; collaboration.  He chose to crush them instead.
